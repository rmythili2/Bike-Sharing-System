# Bike-Sharing-System
Multiple Linear Regression Bike-Sharing System

A bike-sharing system is a service in which bikes are made available for shared use to individuals on a short term basis for a price or free. Many bike share systems allow people to borrow a bike from a "dock" which is usually computer-controlled wherein the user enters the payment information, and the system unlocks it. This bike can then be returned to another dock belonging to the same system.

## General Information
- Problem Statement:
A US bike-sharing provider BoomBikes have contracted a consulting company to understand the factors on which the demand for these shared bikes depends. Specifically, they want to understand the factors affecting the demand for these shared bikes in the American market. The company wants to know:

1. Which variables are significant in predicting the demand for shared bikes.
2. How well those variables describe the bike demands

- Business Goal:
To develop a model for the demand for shared bikes with the available independent variables. It will be used by the management to understand how exactly the demands vary with different features. The management wants to manipulate the business strategy to meet the demand levels and the customers expectations and to understand the demand dynamics of a new market.
- Dataset:
Company has provided dataset day.csv file with the data for couple of years 2018 and 2019.

## Conclusions
Used Multiple Linear Regression and based on the analysis, the following conclusion is derived.
Company should focus on the below variables for predicting the bike sharing demand.
- Season (Spring)
- Months (June, September)
- Weekday (Saturday)
- temp
- Weather situation (Mist+Cloudy, Light Snow)
